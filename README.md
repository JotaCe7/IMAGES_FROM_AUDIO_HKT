# Flask ML API

## Install and run

To run the services using compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build -d
```

To stop the services:

```bash
$ docker-compose down
```

## Tests

### Integration end-to-end

You must have the full pipeline running (see previous section) and the following Python libraries installed:

- [requests==2.28.1](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [pytest==7.1.2](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/)

You can install them using the file `tests/requirements.txt` with:

```bash
$ pip3 install -r tests/requirements.txt
```

Then, from the project root folder run:

```
$ python tests/test_integration.py
```

If the output looks like this, then the integration tests are passing:

```bash
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 0.299s

OK
```

### Modules

We make use of [multi-stage docker builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) so we can have into the same Dockerfile environments for testing and also for deploying our service.

#### Api

Run:

```bash
$ cd api/
$ docker build -t flask_api_test --progress=plain --target test .
```

You will only need to pay attention to the logs corresponding to the testing code which will look like this:

```bash
#10 [test 1/1] RUN ["pytest", "-v", "/src/tests"]
#10 sha256:707efc0d59d04744766193fe6873d212afc0f8e4b28d035a2d2e94b40826604f

```

You are good if all tests are passing.

#### Model

Same as api, run:

```bash
$ cd model/
$ docker build -t model_test --progress=plain --target test .
```
